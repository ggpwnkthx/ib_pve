# Infiniband on Proxmox

Use the one-liner below to download and run the installer.
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggpwnkthx/ib_pve/master/install.sh -O - | sh -
```
CAUTION: DO NOT RUN REMOTE COMMANDS THAT YOU DON'T TRUST. READ THROUGH THE FILE YOU'RE DOWNLOADING BEFORE RUNNING IT. THAT'S JUST COMMON SENSE.

If you ever update Proxmox, you Infiniband drivers will fail. You can easily recompile the DKMS modules with the following command:
```bash
dkms install --all
```
